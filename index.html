        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Tyler Smith. I was born in Portland in 1986. I grew up in Gladstone, OR with two brothers and one sister. I have a background in IT and telecom, recently coming from a small telecom company. I am an avid tech and video game nerd. I have always had a knack for knowing my way around a PC, both inside and out. My lifelong passion for tech has led me to Code Fellows. I hope to learn valuable skills in order to make myself marketable to potential employers, as well as embark on my own personal developement journey.</p>
